**Instructions**

Your client is a clothing brand that is looking for a simple web app to use in their warehouses. To do their work efficiently, the warehouse workers need a fast and simple listing page per product category, where they can check simple product and availability information from a single UI. There are three product categories they are interested in for now: gloves, facemasks, and beanies. Therefore, you should implement three web pages corresponding to those categories that list all the products in a given category. One requirement is to be easily able to switch between product categories quickly. You are free to implement any UI you want, as long as it can display multiple products at once in a straightforward and explicit listing. At this point, it is not necessary to implement filtering or pagination functionality on the page.

The client does not have a ready-made API for this purpose. Instead, they have two different legacy APIs that combined can provide the needed information. The legacy APIs are on critical-maintenance-only mode, and thus further changes to them are not possible. The client knows the APIs are not excellent, but they are asking you to work around any issues in the APIs in your new application. The client has instructed you that both APIs have an internal cache of about 5 minutes.

API documentation is as follows

GET /v2/products/:category – Return a listing of products in a given category.
GET /v2/availability/:manufacturer – Return a list of availability info.
The APIs are running at https://bad-api-assignment.reaktor.com/.
Your task is to implement a web application that fits the client brief and host the running solution somewhere where it can be accessed publicly (e.g. Heroku). Please include a link to the source code and the running application in your application.

**My Implementation**

I've done the web app assuming that the workers would use it from their laptops/tablets, thus having an easy UI is good for tablet use.

* **What happens on page open/refresh?**
  * Fetching the productlist, caching it and showing it/taking this data from the cache if possible
  * Fetching the availability, caching it and showing it for each product using their IDs and changing the "availability box" according (gray = fetching/undefined, green = available, orange = less than 10 products, red = out of stock).

* **Features**
  * All the data is easily accessable and visible
  * Data being recached every 5 mins (needs page refresh)

* **Problems/Issues**
  * All of the availability infos don't necessarily show (at localhost they worked flawessly)
  * AdBlockers cause errors (net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES)
